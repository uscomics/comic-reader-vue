			"Jim Courtney had a dream of being visited by George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. They told him that he was needed to serve his country and was being granted special powers. To activate these powers, all he had to do was touch the flag birthmark on his chest. He was granted Super Strength, near invulnerability to all damage, and the ability to fly.",
			"Shortly after this event, Courtney was recruited to the Legends project, joining the European branch after completing training at Camp X.",
			"The Flag is a Dream Warrior. Anyone touching the flag birthmark on his chest will be granted powers equal to the Flag for 15 minutes."
