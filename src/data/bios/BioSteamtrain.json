			"Clarence Jackson was a slave picking cotton on a Virginia plantation during the U.S. Civil War. After the war General Sherman gave every freeman 40 acres of land and a mule. Clarence worked his land and saved money. Soon he had a few horses and a young wife, but the KKK burned his farm to the ground, killing his wife and causing him to lose an arm when he tried to save her.",
			"His life and body in ruins, he took what he had left and headed out west. An outlaw attempted to rob him, but Captain Æther intervened. Seeing that Clarence was a good man, Captain Æther built him a new steam powered arm and asked for his help fighting Superbrain."
