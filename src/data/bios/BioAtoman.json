			"Barry Dale was a P.O.W. being held in Hiroshima. Just before the atomic bomb was dropped on the city, Gold Venus rescued him. However, as the two were rushing to a makeshift bunker, the bomb was dropped and Dale was hit by a large dose of radiation.",
			"Several years after the war ended, Dale noticed he was not aging. Later still he learns how to absorb energy from his environment and how to rearrange atoms. Inspired by the heroics of Gold Venus, Dale decides to use his powers to help others. The U.S. Government immediately takes notice. Dale is recruited to Camp X as one of its final students and then joins the team known as the Super Agents."
