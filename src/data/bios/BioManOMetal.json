			"Foundry worker Pat Dempsey has an unfortunate accident when a vat of white hot metal spills on him. Rather than being killed, however, he experiences an unexplainable chemical reaction. His skin becomes like blue metal, and he bursts into flames. In his normal human body, he is as vulnerable as any other person, but while on fire, he can melt bullets and grenades.",
			"Unknown to him, the metal from his accident was the same metal used to forge Lúin Celtchar, a legendary Irish flaming lance. The \"accident\" was actually planned by the Túatha Dé Danann as part of a plan to create champions to battle the creatures from the Beyond who were attacking Earth.",
			"Man O' Metal is a member of the Legends Pacific."
