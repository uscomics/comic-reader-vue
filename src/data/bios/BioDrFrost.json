			"Dr. Frost is a Dream Warrior, someone who was given his powers in a dream. With the outbreak of World War Two, Davis Cote was visited by two \"Spirits of Canada\" in his dreams, an Inuit Indian spirit and a Norseman spirit, telling Davis that he was needed to serve his country.",
			"The spirits granted him the \"power of the frozen north\", which is the ability to generate, shape, and control ice and snow. Shortly after gaining these abilities, Davis approached the Canadian government, asking to serve in any way possible. He was enlisted in the Camp X super agent program and joined the Pacific arm of the Legends."
